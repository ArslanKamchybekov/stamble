# AI Development Guide for Stamble

This document provides information for AI developers who want to extend the Stamble application's AI capabilities.

## AI Architecture Overview

The Stamble application uses a multi-agent architecture for stock investment recommendations:

1. **Web Search Agent**: Responsible for finding and analyzing recent news about companies and their stocks
2. **Investment Advisor Agent**: The primary AI agent that collects data and generates final recommendations

## AI Components

### Web Search Agent (`app/ai_agents/web_search_agent.py`)

This agent simulates searching the web for stock-related news. In a production environment, this would use:
- OpenAI's web search tool to find recent news
- Multiple sources to ensure comprehensive coverage
- NLP techniques for sentiment analysis

To enhance this agent:
- Replace mock data with actual web search API calls
- Implement more sophisticated sentiment analysis
- Add entity recognition to identify important events

### Investment Advisor Agent (`app/ai_agents/investment_advisor_agent.py`)

The main agent that:
- Orchestrates data collection from multiple sources
- Uses OpenAI's GPT models to analyze the data
- Generates final investment recommendations

Enhancements to consider:
- Add more complex financial analysis models
- Implement portfolio-wide recommendations
- Support for different investment strategies
- Add time-based predictions

## OpenAI Integration

The application uses the OpenAI Python SDK for:
- Generating investment recommendations based on data
- Analyzing sentiment from news articles
- Synthesizing information into actionable advice

The integration is done through:
```python
self.client = openai.Client(api_key=self.api_key)
```

The main API call for recommendations:
```python
response = await self.client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a financial expert AI assistant..."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ],
    temperature=0.1,
    response_format={"type": "json_object"}
)
```

## Future AI Enhancements

1. **Agent Specialization**:
   - Create specialized agents for different sectors (tech, healthcare, etc.)
   - Add agents for macroeconomic analysis
   - Implement agents for technical chart analysis

2. **Improved Reasoning**:
   - Chain-of-thought reasoning for more transparent recommendations
   - Counterfactual analysis ("What would happen if...")
   - Confidence interval calculations

3. **Advanced Capabilities**:
   - Real-time data processing
   - Historical performance analysis
   - Competitive analysis between companies
   - Risk assessment

4. **Monitoring and Feedback**:
   - Track recommendation performance over time
   - Learn from successful/unsuccessful predictions
   - Adapt to user feedback

## Prompt Engineering

The system uses a structured prompt template that includes:
- Stock performance data
- Recent news about the company
- Market sentiment analysis

To improve the quality of recommendations, consider enhancing the prompts with:
- More detailed industry context
- Historical performance patterns
- Macroeconomic indicators
- Technical analysis signals
